# Cedar Capital Sales Playbook

## Golden Rule

**Always build rapport first.** Getting to know them can mean making money on the deal or nothing at all.

---

## The 5 Steps to Close

1. **Build Rapport** - Active listening, use their name
2. **Understand Their Pain** - Why are they selling?
3. **Present Tense** - Focus on solving today's problem
4. **Get to YES** - Small agreements lead to big ones
5. **Show HOW** - Explain your process clearly

## Seller Call Flow

### 1. Opening
```
"Hi [NAME], this is [YOU] with Cedar Capital. I'm a local home buyer
here in Austin. I understand you might be interested in selling your
property. Is now a good time to chat for a few minutes?"
```

### 2. Property Status
- "Is the home currently listed with an agent?"
  - If YES: "How long has it been listed? Why hasn't it sold?"
  - If NO: Continue to asking price

- "What are you asking for the property?"

### 3. Motivation (Listen for Keywords)
Ask: *"If you don't mind me asking, why are you looking to sell?"*

## Handling Objections

### "What's the most you'll pay?"
```
"That's a great question, [NAME]. To give you a solid offer that makes
sense for both of us, I need a little more information about the property.
Fair enough?"
```

### "I don't want to share my mortgage balance"
```
"I understand protecting personal information. To make you a valid offer,
I need to know what it costs to pay off your existing mortgage. That way
I can structure something that works for you."
```

### "Another buyer offered me $X"
```
"That's great - did you take it? [Let them answer]

I make decisions based on current market realities, not speculation.
Let me take another look at the numbers and give you my best offer.
Fair?"
```

### "My agent/cousin said it's worth $X"
```
"Values have been a roller coaster lately. I'll look at recent sales in your
neighborhood and see what the data shows. Does that sound fair?"
```

### "I'll just list it with an agent"
```
"That might work if you can wait 90+ days for a buyer who needs a loan
and wants repairs done first. We can close in as little as 2 weeks, buy
as-is, and you pay zero fees. Which timeline works better for your situation?"
```

### "Let me talk to my spouse/attorney"
```
"Of course - are you okay with the price and terms we discussed?
[Let them answer]

Would it help if we talked to them together so I can answer their
questions directly?"
```

### "I need time to think"
```
"No problem. While I'm here, what are your main concerns?
Maybe I can help address them now."
```

### "How did you get my information?"
```
"We invest in properties all over [COUNTY] and recently decided to
pick up more houses in your neighborhood. We sent postcards to
everyone in the area. I'm glad you called - can I get your address
so I can pull up your property info?"
```

- "Are you tired of dealing with tenants and maintenance calls?"
- "We can give you a clean exit with cash in hand"

### Vacant Property

- "Let's get you cashed out"

- "Dealing with an inherited property while grieving is tough"
