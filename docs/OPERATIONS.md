## Wholesaling Process

### Overview
Wholesaling = Find deal → Get under contract → Assign contract to buyer → Collect fee

**No money down. No repairs. No ownership.**

---

### Step 1: Find the Deal

**Lead Sources:**
- Direct mail (absentee owners, pre-foreclosure)
- Driving for dollars (vacant, distressed properties)
- Online marketing (website, SEO, PPC)
- Networking (agents, attorneys, other investors)
- Cold calling lists

**Qualification:** Use [Sales Playbook](./SALES-PLAYBOOK.md) to screen leads

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Deal

**Quick Math:**
```
ARV × 70% - Repairs - Your Fee = Max Offer
```

**Your wholesale fee:** $5,000 - $15,000 typical

*Example:*
- ARV: $200,000
- 70% of ARV: $140,000
- Repairs: $30,000
- Your fee: $10,000
- **Max offer to seller: $100,000**

See [Deal Analysis Guide](./DEAL-ANALYSIS.md) for full evaluation process.

---

### Step 3: Make the Offer

**Key Contract Terms:**
- Purchase price (your negotiated amount)
- Earnest money ($100-500 typical)
- Inspection period (10-14 days)
- Closing date (21-30 days out)
- **Assignment clause** - "Buyer and/or assigns"

**Contract:** Use Texas SFR Purchase Contract (TREC form) with assignment language

---

### Step 4: Find a Buyer

**Buyer Sources:**
- Your buyers list (build this constantly)
- Local REIA meetings
- Facebook groups (Austin real estate investors)
- Other wholesalers
- Property listing sites

**Marketing the Deal:**
- Create deal flyer with photos, numbers, ARV
- Blast to buyers list
- Post in investor groups
- Network at meetups

**Buyer Qualification:**
- Proof of funds (cash or hard money approval)
- Track record (have they closed before?)
- Timeline (can they close quickly?)

---

### Step 5: Assign the Contract

**Assignment Agreement includes:**
- Original contract reference
- Assignment fee amount
- Buyer's info
- Closing date

**Collect non-refundable deposit** from buyer ($2,000-5,000)

---

### Step 6: Close the Deal

**Double Close vs. Assignment:**

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Assignment** | Fee is reasonable, seller/buyer okay with transparency |
| **Double Close** | Large fee, want privacy, or contract doesn't allow assignment |

**At Closing:**
- Title company handles paperwork
- Seller gets paid
- Buyer gets property
- You get assignment fee (or spread on double close)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-paying for property** - Stick to 70% rule
2. **No assignment clause** - Always include "and/or assigns"
3. **Too long to close** - Buyers want 2-3 weeks, not 60 days
4. **Weak buyers list** - Always be adding qualified buyers
5. **Poor follow-up** - Fortune is in the follow-up
6. **No earnest money from buyer** - Get non-refundable deposit
7. **Skipping inspection** - Always inspect or have buyer inspect
